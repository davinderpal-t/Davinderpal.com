		<p>Hello there, my name is Davinderpal but I go by Dav. This is a website I made to centralize a lot of
			creations in my life that I'm proud of for one reason or another.<br />
			This was originally started because I was gifted the domain <a
				href="https://www.davinderpal.com/">davinderpal.com</a> by my good friend <a
				href="https://www.cromlechs.org/">Zhongyou Wu</a>.<br />
			I'm a self-taught Web Developer who is now doing Computer Science at UT Austin. I also enjoy doing digital
			art, reading manga, and all things Pokémon related.<br />
			I also enjoy messing around with spreadsheets and am
			looking to get more skilled in Game Development although I have made a few very small-scale low-quality
			games in the past. You can check those out in my <a href="./portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> and I would
			appreciate it if you gave me any feedback on them even if it is negative.
		</p>
